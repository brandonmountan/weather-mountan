# weather-mountan

## Description

The motivation for this project was to accomplish the difficult task of starting a website from scratch (with no starter code) and incorporating a weather API to pull data. I built this project so I could have an example website with many different subjects we learned throughout the first part of the course. This website is able to provide weather data for any city that is searched. I learned a lot about how to interact with REST APIs and how the documentation works.
